      <p>
        Launched in 2020, Decentraland is a virtual social world, the first
        decentralized metaverse, and the only one that is open source. Within
        the Decentraland platform, which can run on a browser or desktop client,
        users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications as
        well as socialize and attend a wide range of daily, community-driven
        events. Decentraland is unique in that it is owned, created, and
        governed by the people who use it every day. Through Decentraland’s
        decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) users can submit proposals
        and even apply for grants for the community to vote on.
